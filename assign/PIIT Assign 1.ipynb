    "| **What Is Data Analysis?**  | Data analysis refers to the act of examining raw facts in order to extract meaning and turn them into useful knowledge. It typically revolves around answering what has happened and why it happened. It might use data from survey results, performance metrics, or even feedback forms and then transform that information into insights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n",
    "| **What Is Data Analytics?** | Data analytics uses data to find patterns, forecast future behavior, and even prescribe actions. Essentially, it’s a broader discipline than data analysis that begins with collecting large volumes of structured or unstructured data, cleaning, processing, and then applying statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or data mining techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",
    "| **Goal**                    | The primary goal of data analysis is to break down past data in order to describe what has already happened and, in some cases, explain why it happened. So, essentially, it helps clarify outcomes by summarizing and interpreting historical patterns. <br><br> Data analytics, on the other hand, is used to project what’s likely to happen next and support decision-making that focuses on the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",
    "| **Focus**                   | Data analysis and analytics areas of focus aren’t quite the same either. The former concentrates on identifying meaningful insights in existing datasets, often through straightforward techniques such as calculating averages, looking at frequency counts, or generating standard reports. It helps answer questions such as: “What happened?” and “How often did it occur?” <br><br> Data analytics, however, digs much deeper. Its focus stretches to relationships, patterns, and probabilities. This broader focus is particularly useful when organizations want to forecast demand or identify risks before they happen. |\n",

And we also analyzed the impact of self-reflection on the relationship between the impostor phenomenon and vicarious learning. \n",
    "- Based on the 7 responses per item technique, a minimum sample size of 553 respondents was collected.

    "- The study highlights the significance of imposters' self-regulatory efforts, as well as their utilization of impression management and vicarious learning techniques, in diminishing the impact of the impostor phenomenon and promoting higher job performance.\n",
    "- The findings of the study demonstrate that the association between IP and job performance is influenced by the mediating role of impression management and Vicarious Learning."
